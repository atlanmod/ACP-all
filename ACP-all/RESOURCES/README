%%%% Examples and source code prototype for the extracting a summary of
all the problems in a rule-based system

========== Requirements

This was done with Eclipse and plugin pydev (https://www.pydev.org/)
    Python v.3.7.3 
    Z3py (pip3 install z3-solver==4.8.5.0)
    (from  https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/)
 
========== How to use

SEE examples/normalized/testAdi2009.py 

the line "table.compute_table(size, REQ)" compute the problems
look at the end of the file and execute it

========== Repository structure
