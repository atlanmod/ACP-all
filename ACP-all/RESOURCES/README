* 23/3/2020
change prime with pyeda better performances and minimum
but deactivate it after tactic since too costly
add allowed computation 
Change heuristic with length, but also measure

* 25/3/2020
Test with solver_inclusion to eliminate JUNK cases
but it does not remove it saved in OLDCODE

* 26/3/2020
Try new test with DENIED, take care of the place of the test
since once eliminated it has been already seen
No need of minimizing since we have a AND-term X DNF

* TODO ===================

TODO DENIED : def ? minimizing ?

improve heuristic if non several time ?
if newpbs included in known after simplif ?

%%%% 4/2/2020

%%%% Examples and source code prototype for computing a simplified 
%%%% summary of all the problems

========== Requirements

This was done with Eclipse and plugin pydev (https://www.pydev.org/)
    Python v.3.7.3 
    Z3py (pip3 install z3-solver==4.8.5.0)
    (from  https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/)
    
========== How to use

SEE examples/enumerate/testAdi2009.py 

the line "table.compute_table(REQ, size)" compute the problems
look at the end of the file and execute it

SEE examples/normalized/testAdi2009.py
same scenario with the combine algorithm 
but in addition "table.compare_problems(size, REQ)" can be used
to compare both results


========== Repository structure

RESOURCES/


examples/enumerate contains some examples and results for enumerate
examples/combine contains some examples and results for combine

src/ contains the same base code than ACP (https://github.com/atlanmod/ACP) 
    enumerative/ for the enumerative algorithm
    normalized/ for the combine algorithm
